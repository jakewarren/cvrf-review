Therefore potential exploitability (or lack thereof) of Fortinet products by the threat actor is not possible to disprove.However, all of the affected makes/models listed in the post had \"well-known, public vulnerabilities\".

To lower the chances of infection: Talos reports that the malware system scans TCP ports 23, 80, 2000 and 8080, as a way to discover new potential targets. Thus closing those ports on the Fortinet device, via the system configuration, will render the device \"invisible\" to the current variant of the malware piece. As always, we recommend to upgrade Fortinet devices to the latest versions available, which include fixes for all known issues, thereby reducing the potential attack surface in general. Fortinet FortiGuard SE Team provided a general analysis of the malware piece, along with recommendations [2] Fortinet PSIRT will continue to monitor the situation, and update the advisory in case of further findings and developments.",
