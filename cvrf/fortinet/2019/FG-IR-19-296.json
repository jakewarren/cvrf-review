This is a feature that exists to enable connecting to collectors from the supervisor when there is a firewall between the collector and the supervisor.",

Workaround (for FortiSIEM version 5.2.6 and lower): Customers who are not using the reverse tunnel feature are advised to disable SSH service on port 19999 by following the steps below :1. SSH to the Supervisor node as the root user.2. Remove tunneluser SSH configuration file to disable listening on port 19999:rm -f /etc/ssh/sshd_config.tunneluserecho rm -f /etc/ssh/sshd_config.tunneluser >> /etc/init.d/phProvision.sh3. Then terminate sshd running on TCP Port 19999 as follows:pkill -f /usr/sbin/sshd -p 199994.Additional steps can be performed on Supervisor to remove the keys associated with tunneluser account:rm -f /opt/phoenix/deployment/id_rsa.pub.tunneluserrm -f /home/tunneluser/.ssh/authorized_keysrm -f /opt/phoenix/id_rsa.tunneluser ~admin/.ssh/id_rsaCustomers are also advised to disable \"tunneluser\" SSH access on port 22 by following the steps bwlow:1. SSH to the Supervisor node as the root user.2. Add/edit the following line in sshd_config file: echo DenyUsers tunneluser >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config3. service sshd restart",
