For customer using affected models, Fortinet PSIRT suggests checking the IPMI interface settings and making sure the IPMI port option is set to \"Dedicated\" instead of \"Failover\". The procedure is detailed in this document entry: https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortimanager/hardware/disable-the-ipmi-port/ As a measure of precaution, and regardless the product, when an IPMI port is present, we also suggest to not leave the IPMI interface admin password to its default value.
