Concrete impact may be \"load and execute arbitrary code outside the visibility of the user and operating system\", or \"system crash or system instability\".The assigned CVEs are:CVEs:Intel Manageability Engine Firmware 11.0.x.x/11.5.x.x/11.6.x.x/11.7.x.x/11.10.x.x/11.20.x.xCVE-2017-5705CVE-2017-5708CVE-2017-5711CVE-2017-5712Intel Manageability Engine Firmware 8.x/9.x/10.xCVE-2017-5711CVE-2017-5712Server Platform Service 4.0.x.xCVE-2017-5706CVE-2017-5709IntelTrusted Execution Engine 3.0.x.xCVE-2017-5707CVE-2017-5710",

          "#text": "Note that all related CVEs are \"Privilege Escalation\" type vulnerabilities. Arbitrary code execution is therefore only possible on the aforementioned products if the attack is combined with a local or remote code execution vulnerability (unrelated to intel issues) in the affected products. The Intel CVEs only aggravate the situation, if such vulnerabilities exist. Based on the above, the impact to Fortinet products is low to \"nonexistent\". * For FortiWeb 1000E, the affected firmware has undergone a precaution patching, in system BIOS PN P21583-02: New units will run a non-affected firmware. There is no firmware upgrade needed for existing units, however (see above: vulnerable functions not enabled). * For FortiGate 500E and 501E, the affected firmware has been patched under FortiBIOS version 05000003: new units will run a non-affected firmware. For existing units, the exploitation risk is low, as an attack may only be possible if combined with an additional local or remote code execution vulnerability, unrelated to this issue - if such vulnerabilities exist and are successfully exploited. To lower your attack risk and reduce the possibility of an \"already existing local or remote code execution vulnerability\" (as referred to above), upgrading to our latest publicly available software version is highly recommended. Please contact your local TAC for more information or request for BIOS update. Update History: 01-04-2018 Initial version 01-18-2018 Assessment and Solution updated",
