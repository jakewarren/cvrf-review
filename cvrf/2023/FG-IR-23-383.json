The LocalNet attack allows an attacker to force the usage of local network access features of the VPN to access unencrypted traffic.The ServerIP attack allows an attacker to intercept traffic sent to a spoofed VPN gateway via DNS spoofing attacks.These attacks do not enable the attacker to decrypt the encrypted traffic but rather will try to redirect the traffic through attacker controlled channels before the traffic is encrypted by the VPN.",

It will detect DNS spoofing attempts and display a \"Security Alert\" pop up. Only if \"Do not alert when the certificate is invalid\" is checked in the FortiClient parameters, the VPN user is at risk of the ServerIP attack.
